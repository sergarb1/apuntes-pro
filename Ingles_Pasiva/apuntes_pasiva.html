                <p>Imagine you have a really cool toy, let's say, a racing car. There are two main ways to talk about it:</p>
                <div class="card p-4 bg-surface">
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-running me-2 text-success"></i> <strong>Active Voice:</strong> "My brother built this car." Here, your brother is the "hero," the one who did the action. He's the focus.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-shield-alt me-2 text-info"></i> <strong>Passive Voice:</strong> "This car was built by my brother." Now the car is the "hero"! The important thing is what happened to the car, not so much who built it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-3">In short, the passive voice shifts the focus from the person or thing doing the action (the agent) to the person or thing receiving the action (the object). It's like changing the camera angle in a movie. And it's super useful!</p>
                <div class="timer-warning mt-4 p-3">
                    <i class="fas fa-microscope me-2"></i> <strong>Quick Tip: The Zombie Test!</strong><br>
                    If you can add "by zombies" at the end of a sentence and it still makes sense, it's very likely passive! (e.g., "The car was stolen *by zombies*"). If not, it's probably active.
                </div>

            <!-- Why use Passive? -->
            <section class="mb-5">
                <h2 class="mb-4"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i> Why, when and where to use the Passive Voice?</h2>
                <p>The passive voice is a powerful tool in English to change the focus of a sentence. We don't use it just to "sound smarter," but because it allows us to be clearer or more diplomatic in certain situations. We use it when the <strong>object</strong> (the received action) is more important or relevant than the <strong>subject</strong> (the one performing the action), or when the agent is unknown, obvious, or we want to keep it in the background.</p>
                <div class="card p-4 bg-surface">
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-search me-2 text-info"></i> <strong>1. Focus on the result/action:</strong> When what truly interests us is what happened, rather than who did it.
                            <br><small class="ms-4">Ex: "The bridge <strong>was built</strong> in 1890." (The construction of the bridge is important; the builder could be a team, a generic entity, and we don't need to name them to understand the fact).</small></li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-user-secret me-2 text-secondary"></i> <strong>2. Unknown or obvious agent:</strong> When we don't know who performed the action, or it's so obvious it doesn't need to be stated.
                            <br><small class="ms-4">Ex: "My wallet <strong>was stolen</strong>." (I don't know who stole it, so it's more honest not to say "someone"). "The thief <strong>was arrested</strong>." (It's obvious it was the police, right? No need to say it).</small></li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-file-alt me-2 text-primary"></i> <strong>3. Formal or scientific texts:</strong> To maintain an objective and impersonal tone. This way, the text focuses on the facts, not on the people who observed or performed them.
                            <br><small class="ms-4">Ex: "The experiment <strong>was conducted</strong> at high temperatures." (Sounds more scientific than "We conducted the experiment...").</small></li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-microphone-slash me-2 text-warning"></i> <strong>4. Avoid mentioning the agent:</strong> Sometimes, out of courtesy, to avoid blaming someone, or simply because the agent is not relevant to the main message.
                            <br><small class="ms-4">Ex: "Mistakes <strong>were made</strong>." (Sounds softer than "You made mistakes.").</small></li>

                <p>Although useful, using the passive voice all the time can make your writing sound a bit boring, robotic, or difficult to understand. Think of it as a special tool; don't use it for everything. It's best to avoid it when:</p>

                        <li><i class="fas fa-bullhorn me-2 text-warning"></i> <strong>2. You want to emphasize the agent:</strong> If it's important *who* did the action, put them first! The active voice is your best friend here.</li>

                        <li><i class="fas fa-times-circle me-2 text-danger"></i> <strong>2. Confusing "TO BE" tenses:</strong> If the active verb was "writes" (present), "TO BE" must be "is/are". If it was "wrote" (past), "TO BE" must be "was/were". It's the tense thermometer!
                            <br><small class="ms-4">Incorrect: "Books was written." | Correct: "Books <strong>were</strong> written."</small></li>

If they are active, mentally transform them into passive! You'll see how quickly you start recognizing them!</p>
